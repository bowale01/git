## Git Workflow

Git Workflow refers to a structured process or set of practices for managing branches, commits, and collaboration in a Git-based version control system. It defines how developers interact with a Git repository to work on and deliver code efficiently. Common Git workflows include:

### 1. Centralized Workflow

 
    #### . Single main branch (e.g., master or main) where all commits are pushed.
    #### . Simple, but not ideal for large teams due to risk of conflicts.
   
### 2. Feature Branch Workflow

    ####  . Each feature is developed in its own branch.
    ####  . Merges are done into the main branch after review/testing.


### 3. Gitflow Workflow

    #### . Uses dedicated branches for features, releases, and bug fixes.
Structure:

main for production code.
develop for integration.
Feature, hotfix, and release branches for specific tasks.
Forking Workflow

Used in open-source projects.
Developers fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
Trunk-Based Development

Developers commit frequently to a single main branch.
Encourages small, incremental changes.
Git Runner
A Git Runner is a component used in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, particularly with GitLab CI/CD.

What is a GitLab Runner?
A GitLab Runner is an application used to execute jobs in GitLab CI/CD pipelines.
It listens for jobs defined in a .gitlab-ci.yml file and performs tasks like building, testing, or deploying code.
Types of Runners:
Shared Runners:

Provided by GitLab and shared across multiple projects.
Ideal for quick setups.
Group Runners:

Assigned to a specific group of projects.
Specific Runners:

Dedicated to one project or instance.
Can be customized based on the project's needs.
How Runners Work:
GitLab sends pipeline jobs to the runner.
The runner pulls the code and executes tasks based on the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
It supports multiple executors like Docker, Shell, Kubernetes, and Virtual Machines.
Why Use GitLab Runners?
Automates testing and deployment.
Scales with your infrastructure.
Supports multiple programming languages and environments.
By combining Git workflows and Git runners effectively, teams can streamline collaboration, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure code quality in their software projects.
